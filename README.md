# CodeBox
The easy custom command prompt program that allows you to do certain things on your computer.
# Dev Log
This dev log is empty because this is the first build of the program!
# Bugs
None known yet.
# Info
Make sure that after running the installer, an ` Easy Technologies ` folder is made in ` Program Files ` or ` Program Files (x86) `. Inside there should be a ` Code Box ` folder, and inside of that there should be a batch file called ` codeBox.bat `  and a ` User Files ` folder. In ` User Files `, you should have a ` dirs.txt `. The program is only for Windows. We are working on porting it to an exe program as well as a Linux and a Mac program.
# Download
  Download the `CodeBox Installer.exe` file, and run it to easily install the files. Use the `Info` section to ensure everything is working. You can add a shortcut to your desktop of the ` codeBox.bat ` file.
