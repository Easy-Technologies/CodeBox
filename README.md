# CodeBox
The easy custom command prompt program that allows you to do certain things on your computer.
# Dev Log
This dev log is empty because this is the first build of the program!
# Bugs
None known yet.
# Info
Make sure that after running the installer, a ` CodeBox ` folder is made in ` Program Files `. Inside, there should be a batch file called ` codeBox.bat `  and a ` User Files ` folder. In ` User Files `, you should have a ` dirs.txt `. The program is only for Windows currently, and won't install on anything older than Windows 7. We are working on porting it to an exe program. 
# Download
## Working
  Download the CodeBox folder in the repository, and put it into your Program Files folder. You can make a shortcut to the batch file. We will soon have an exe version out with a default shortcut made already, but hang tight for now.
## Broken
Download the ` codeBoxInstaller.bat ` file and run it.
